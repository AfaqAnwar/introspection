 as an aside, i think this question is best written by other people. so if you have any suggestions for what this part _should_ say, please do not hesitate to tell me.","books: almost anything fantasy: the lord of the rings (tolkien); the wheel of time (sadly, robert jordan passed away before completing it), the death gate cycle (weis & hickman); memory, sorrow and thorn (tad williams); riftwar legacy (raymond e. feist), ... also the da vinci code (dan brown).   movies: avatar, dark city, the game, inception, monty python and the quest for the holy grail, memento, pay it forward, ghost in the shell, and inside man. i also like cartoons; watching them and being enchanted by them feels like being a child all over again. mostly, i like to watch movies together with other people, so if there is a movie you are really excited about, send me a message and maybe we can go see it together.   music: i like various music styles, although i have a low tolerance for the likes of rap and hip hop. i usually listen to: classical music (mozart, beethoven, charpentier); symphonic rock (or maybe goth rock) (nightwish, within temptation, evanescense); punk (satanic surfers, bad religion, hladno pivo); folk music (the dubliners, saban bajramovic); dance (milk inc), techno (basshunter) and some mixed or harder to classify styles (zdob si zdub, haggard, dropkick murphys). i also like the - funny yet insightful - songs by tom lehrer. and man should certainly be in this list!   food: i like most of the food i've tasted in my life. i also like to cook, sometimes, especially for someone special. i love asian (especially thai and chinese) food. i don't like liver, mamaliga, yoghurt, and probably a couple of other things.","happiness, fun, friends, hugs, fresh air, and the internet  i've lived extensive periods without these (sometimes lacking all of them at the same time), so, obviously, i _can_ do without them, but these things are so central to my life that missing one makes me feel incomplete.","life, the universe, and everything. me, my friends, and everyone else. programming, politics, and philosophy. the past, the present, and the future. i think (and fret) a lot. :-)  i care (and thus think) about fairness, the environment, animal rights, and programming languages.  my dream is to one day create a programming language that is suitable for interactive use and for writing large projects, and which is safer (in terms of mistakes one can make) and more flexible (or powerful) than languages in common use today. i have it all but figured out.","doing the same thing i do every night. in my case, that's not taking over the world, but trying to make my world a better place, which will hopefully improve it for other people as well. for example, i maintain a website (http://inglorion.net/) with essays about things i feel people should know, and links to pages that i feel deserve more attention.","hmm, so you want to know my little secret, ey? well, i believe that, especially in relationships, the problem is often too _little_ openness, so i am more into telling as much as possible as accurately as possible, and sooner rather than later. there are really only 2 reasons i keep secrets:  1. because they involve other people. unless i know they are ok with it, i try not to bandy about things that they would rather keep private.  2. because i want to keep it for later. for example, i am not going to tell you what is in your present until you've opened it.  as for all the weird and wonderful things i haven't told you yet...if you are interested, send me a message and start discovering! :-d","you should message me if...well, if you feel like it, really. there is no reason not to, really, unless you're really not interested in me at all. i love to get messages from people. :-d  some reasons you might want to message me (in no particular order):  - you live near me and would like to meet up. i like making new friends!  - i checked out your profile, but didn't write you a message. this probably means i intended to write to you, but lacked the time or was too tired. working full-time makes me that way. :-(  - you found something on my profile that you would like to talk about. for example, an interest we have in common, or something you agree or disagree with.  - you thought of a reason that you think should be listed here, but isn't.",INTP,"Liberal and artisitc, impulsive and spontaneous, contemplative, team working and trusting, laid back and relaxed"

french, c++","i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before the world. i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result, you are probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid you, but that seems silly. as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are too.","i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance, noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi to try and gently flirt with ego death.","improvising in different contexts. alternating between being present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and raunchy humor.","my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back to this.","okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like being in the crosshairs. for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille, baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco, perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i was young, i was a rabid asimov reader. directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky, herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang, gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc. but i also like a good amount of ""trashy"" stuff. too much to name. i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the prisoner, lost, fringe. a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay: art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers, maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings, omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk, robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit, juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b'more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz, techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc. a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my sensibility: andy
